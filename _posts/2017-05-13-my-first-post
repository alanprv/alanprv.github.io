Hi there!

This is my first blog post in an actual proper blog. I'm not saying [wordpress] or [blogger] are boring, they're just not enough. I want to have
a proper personal webpage where I can dump my stuff, be that book reviews,
original articles about my interests, etc. I understand that, by writing political opinion, I am effectively competing against the whole internet. But I'm not doing that. I'm not expecting millions of visitors (the hosting I get for free in [github-pages]) can probably cope with about 500 requests at the same time (actually, I don't know how much, I'll have to check) but you get my point.
